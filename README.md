# LI4_1718

This repository holds the project regarding the UC **LI4**, in which we developed a **multiplatform** system that would help to **distribute pastry products to domicile**.

The first phase, **fundament**, is based on why this is a *viable project* and what *impacts* it will have on the business economy itself. In addition, was developed a *development plan*, in which is expected to be the *organization* and *distribution of the tasks* until the end of the project.

The second phase of the project is called **specification**. In this, the *project requirements* were collected and analyzed, as well as the entire *project modulation*. This is constituted by the modeling of context, structural, interaction, data and interface.

Finally, we moved to the final phase, the **implementation**. In this, the models specified in the previous phase were materialized, resulting in a project implemented and ready to use.

With that in mind, we created 4 different websites, one for each type of client: *baker*, *courier*, *admin* and *client*. There one can interact with the system according to their functions. For instance, the baker can tick the products that are made, the courier has access to a map displaying the address of the different clients that he needs to deliver the orders. The client can subscribe to different services or just make a singular order.

The project was developed using just **Microsoft** products. Therefore, we used the **ASP.NET MVC** web application framework developed by Microsoft. For the database (DB), we used the **SQL Server**. Besides that, we used the **ADO.NET Entity Framework** to facilitate the connection between the "model" of the MVC and the actual DB. For the web pages were used the **Bootstrap** library for the visually appealing aspect and the **Razor** view engine to make possible dynamic web pages.

Finally, everything was written using in **C#**, some *javascript*, *CSS*, *HTML*, and that's it! Hope you like it!
